# FootballVision ⚽

**Football betting simulation game developed in C++**

## 📋 Description

FootballVision is a console-based football betting simulation game developed during my first year of Computer Engineering. The game allows players to place bets on virtual matches between Spanish La Liga teams and manage their credit balance through strategic decisions.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive User Interface**: Console-based menu system with clear navigation
- **Player Registration**: Personalized experience with player name and nickname
- **Credit Management**: Three difficulty levels (5, 10, or 15 initial credits)
- **Match Simulation**: Random match outcomes between 8 Spanish football teams
- **Score Tracking**: Persistent high score system using file storage
- **Replay Functionality**: Option to continue playing or exit after each game

## 🎮 Gameplay

1. **Registration**: Enter your name and nickname
2. **Credit Selection**: Choose your starting credits (difficulty level):
   - 5 credits (Hard)
   - 10 credits (Normal)  
   - 15 credits (Easy)
3. **Betting**: Place bets on matches between teams
4. **Match Results**: Random outcomes determine wins/losses
5. **Score Management**: Track your performance and compare with high scores

## 🏆 Featured Teams

- RC Celta de Vigo
- FC Barcelona
- Real Madrid
- Atlético de Madrid
- Real Betis Balompié
- Sevilla FC
- Valencia CF
- Athletic Club

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Language**: C++
- **Compiler**: Code::Blocks project
- **Architecture**: Modular design with separated functions
- **Data Storage**: File-based score persistence
- **Random Generation**: Time-seeded random number generation for match outcomes
